### Hello everyone,

You are probably wondering why someone whose mission is to provide Turkish content, free content and such things has opened an English section for himself. The purpose of this section is both to improve my own English and to notice that foreigners visit my site very frequently.

The English and Turkish content will not be the same, in this section it will mostly be my thoughts, experiences and journey, not very technical content.

## WhoIAm

I’m enay, I’ve been dealing with hacking since I was about 13 years old, this field which I started as a hobby has gradually turned into an ideal and a goal. Now I see it as something I must do in my life. In my teenage years I did ethical but illegal things, my blood was running fast and I wanted to fully see what I was capable of and the consequences. One day (when I was 17) when the cyber police came to my door, I saw that some things could actually have real consequences. I’m lucky that I got away with just giving a small statement, it was a lesson for me and I stopped my illegal activities.

Currently, I’m a 2nd year university student, studying MIS and I also have a cybersecurity club that I founded. I provide freelance pentesting services to various companies, thanks to my old connections if companies request it I can do CTI studies and I do bugbounty from time to time.

In the future, I have dreams such as working in a well-paid job, marrying a good person, 1 daughter and 1 son, a Golf 7.5 or Passat imp model car, a house in a good location. but.\
I also have a dream that contradicts all of this, to establish an apt group, make a money hit and retire. Let’s see what fate will show in the future :D
